## Inspiration
The name MuhamMart, came to our minds immediately after we saw the problem statement. We hope it does not come across as offensive, we felt that it was quite a catchy name that captures both the organisation and the web app's purpose. We mostly took design inspirations from popular online stores like Shopee. 
## What it does
MuhamMart is a minimart web app designed for Muhammadiyah Welfare Home. Users can buy products they need using vouchers, while admins can manage these users
## How we built it
We used React.js with Material-UI for the frontend and firebase for the database.
## Challenges we ran into
Very constrainted time, we were quite unfortunate to have been quite busy this week, and thus did not manage to spend as much time as we hoped on this project. It was also our first time building a web app, since we are more familiar with desktop and mobile applications.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
For how constrainted the time period is, I think we did a decent job, especially considering how fast we needed to adapt to build the web app.
## What we learned
Other than learning the tech stack we used, we learnt more about how to build a proper product, thinking of scalability, UI design, and many other things. It was quite an enriching experience
## What's next for MuhamMart
We hope to work with Muhammadiyah Welfare Home if our project is good enough
